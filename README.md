# ArchipelagoRb
A rubygem that allows a Ruby-based client to interface with the 
Archipelago Multiworld Randomizer.

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add archipelago_rb

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by 
executing:

    $ gem install archipelago_rb

## Usage

*Documentation is currently WIP.*
Feel free to shoot an email to **archipelago_rb@eggslashether.com**, 
shoot a message to **eggslashether** on Discord, or look at [https://www.npmjs.com/package/archipelago.js](https://thephar.github.io/Archipelago.JS/)
 - the methods were made to be mostly similar. HOWEVER, when attaching a
 listener, please use a string instead of passing the packet type.

I love helping people unfamiliar with Ruby, but the goal is to get this 
out ASAP. Better documentation will follow!
